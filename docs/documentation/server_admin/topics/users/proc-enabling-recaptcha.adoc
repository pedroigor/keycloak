= Enabling reCAPTCHA

[role="_abstract"]
To safeguard registration against bots, {project_name} has integration with Google reCAPTCHA Enterprise.
The default theme (`register.ftl`) supports both v2 (visible, checkbox-based) and v3 (score-based, invisible) reCAPTCHA (see https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/choose-key-type[Choose the appropriate reCAPTCHA key type]).

.Procedure
. Enter the following URL in a browser:
+
[source,bash,subs=+attributes]
----
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/enterprise
----

. Create a key for a "Website" platform, and choose the desired key type. Leave the defaults for v3 reCAPTCHA (invisible), or toggle *Use checkbox challenge* for a v2 reCAPTCHA (visible). Note the site key for future use in this procedure.
+
NOTE: The localhost works by default. You do not have to specify a domain.
+
. On your Google Cloud Project, go to *Credentials* and create a new API key.
+
NOTE: For better security, click on *edit api key* and add an API restriction to restrict the key to the *reCAPTCHA Enterprise API* only.
+
. Navigate to the {project_name} admin console.
. Click *Authentication* in the menu. 
. Click the *Flows* tab.
. Select *Registration* from the list.
. Set the *reCAPTCHA Enterprise* requirement to *Required*. This enables
reCAPTCHA.
. Click the *gear icon* ⚙️ on the *reCAPTCHA* row.
. Click the *Config* link.

.. Enter the *Recaptcha Project ID* of your Google Cloud console project.
.. Enter the *Recaptcha Site Key* generated at the beginning of the procedure.
.. Enter the *Recaptcha API Key* generated at the beginning of the procedure.
.. Toggle **ReCAPTCHA v3** according to your Site Key type: on for invisible, score-based reCAPTCHA (v3), off for visible, checkbox-based reCAPTCHA (v2).
.. (Optional) Customize the *Min. Score Threshold* as you see fit: this is the minimal score a user should achieve on reCAPTCHA to be allowed to register, between 0.0 and 1.0 (see https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/interpret-assessment-website#interpret_scores[interpret scores]).
. Authorize Google to use the registration page as an iframe.
.. (Optional) Toggle *Use recaptcha.net* to use `www.recatcha.net` instead of `www.google.com` domain for cookies. See https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq[reCAPTCHA faq] for more information.
+
NOTE: In {project_name}, websites cannot include a login page dialog in an iframe. This restriction is to prevent clickjacking attacks. You need to change the default HTTP response headers that is set in {project_name}.
+
