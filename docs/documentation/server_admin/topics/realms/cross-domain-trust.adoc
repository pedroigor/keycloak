=== Configuring Cross-Domain Trusts

Cross-domain trusts can be defined at the realm level to specify trusted security domains external to Keycloak. This set of trusted
domains is used by other features, such as the <<_assertion_grant,JWTs as Authorization Grants>> feature which allows external entities
to request access tokens for users.

To configure a trusted domain:

. Go to `Realm settings`
. Select the `Cross-Domain Trust` tab
. Create a trusted domain entry
. Save the changes

Each cross-domain trust configuration contains 3 elements:

* Issuer: The URI identifying this trusted domain. This value will be used to verify the issuer on assertions signed by this trusted domain.
* Audience: The URI identifying the audience of assertions submitted by this trusted domain. This value will be used to verify the audience on assertions signed by this trusted domain.
* Certificate: The base64 encoded X509 signing certificate of the trusted domain. This will be used to verify assertions signed by this trusted domain.
